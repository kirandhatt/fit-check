# FitCheck: Sizing Simplified

## Overview

FitCheck is a Google Chrome Extension that allows users to input and store their clothing measurements. When shopping on fashion websites, the extension automatically analyzes the site's sizing information and recommends the best size for the user based on their stored measurements.

### Problem

This is a problem that I have faced myself. Online clothing shopping often results in ill-fitting purchases due to inconsistent sizing across brands. This leads to customer frustration, increased returns, and environmental waste. FitCheck aims to solve this problem by providing personalized size recommendations based on the user's actual measurements and each brand's specific sizing.

### User Profile

FitCheck is designed for online shoppers who frequently buy clothing from various brands online. Users will input their measurements once (or whenever they choose to update it) and then rely on the extension for size recommendations while browsing different fashion websites.

### Features

1. User can input and store personal body measurements (chest, waist, hips)
2. Extension automatically detects when user is on a supported fashion website
3. FitCheck scans the website for sizing information
4. Extension provides a size recommendation based on the user's measurements and the website's size chart
5. Users can update their measurements at any time
6. FitCheck supports multiple types of clothing (tops, bottoms, dresses, etc.)
7. Extension provides a confidence level for each recommendation
